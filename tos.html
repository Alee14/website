            <p>We enforce this nickname policy to keep a clean, friendly community.</p>
            <p>Our nickname system is different, using the command <code class="green-text">am:nick [your nickname]</code> so our staff team can approve it first. This system is set in place so that the community is a nice place to be for everyone.
                To have your nickname accepted, it must comply with the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>No offensive words</li>
                <li>No symbols</li>
                <li>Not attention-grabbing (i.e. getting to the top of the list by using a symbol)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Any display name that does not follow the guidelines above will have the following done to it:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Censoring your nickname/username</li>
                <li>Ignoring the nickname change from AstralMod</li>
            </ul>

        <p>These are the frequently asked questions that you might ask the staffs.</p>
        <ul class="none">

            <li>Q: I was banned for no reason! I hate the staff…</li>
            <li>A: Well… if you were banned for no reason you can ask our staff team and they will tell you why you were banned.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div id="conclusion">
        <p>If a rule is broken, no need to panic, it's just a heads up on what’s coming if you were to break another rule and if you got mistakenly warned please contact one of the staff immediately.</p>
        <p>If there's staff abusing their powers please report them to Alee immediately.</p>
        <p>Thanks for reading the ToS!</p>
